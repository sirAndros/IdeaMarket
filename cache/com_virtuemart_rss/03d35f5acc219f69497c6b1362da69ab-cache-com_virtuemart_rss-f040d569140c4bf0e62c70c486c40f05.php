<p>This release is introducing SOFORT Banking, a popular payment solution in 10 european countries. We also integrated some bug fixes again, see the <a href="http://virtuemart.net/#ListBugs">list</a> below.</p>
<h2>SOFORT Banking: The attractive payment method for you</h2>
<p>Your customers simply pay in your online shop just as they are used to: by entering their familiar online banking login details and confirmation codes ensuring a maximum level of security. You will receive a real-time transaction confirmation immediately after the transfer has been listed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sofort.com/eng-INT/"><img style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;" src="https://www.sofort.com/var/sofort/storage/images/media/images/logos/sofort-ag-the-payment-network/651-9-ger-DE/SOFORT-AG-The-Payment-Network_header.png" alt="Sofort Banking" />SOFORT Banking</a> is a direct payment system and works like an automated advanced payment (by bank transfer) within seconds.</p>
<p>When shopping online, your customer selects SOFORT Banking as a payment method. Then, your customer selects his/her country and enters the bank sort code into a securely encrypted payment wizard. Afterwards, the customer enters his/her online banking login details and confirms the credit transfer by entering a confirmation code.</p>
<p>Your benefit: You will receive a real-time transaction confirmation that a transfer has been listed.</p>

Usually if the problem is within the core files, we follow security by obscurity, which means we do not exactly explain where to find the exploit. But the latest possible sql injection is in fact a matter of the template. So this time we will explain exactly what happened.</p>

<p>The idea behind VirtueMart is that a lot people participate in the project. This means that there are a lot 3rd party developers and webagencies using VirtueMart. But the disadvantage of this system compared to a unified trademark policy is that a also not qualified people offer their service. This leads to frustrated customers who often payed high prices for crappy templates (deleting virtuemart standard views completly) or completly misuse of the tax settings and so on. We add more and more documentation on docs.virtuemart.net, help is very welcome, but documentation won't solve the problem.</p>
